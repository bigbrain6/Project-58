    <h1> My favourite hobby </h1>
    <h2> Listening to music</h2>
    <section id="bio">
      <p>I like listening to music because it's fun and it can say a lot of sounds, there are so many diffrent genres, such as jazz, hip hop, and electronic. Some times when you need to feel calm some slow paced music can help in doing so. It's just fun to do nothing and just relax and listen to music, it might not sound fun but it is, but you might have a different perspective, and I can respect that.
